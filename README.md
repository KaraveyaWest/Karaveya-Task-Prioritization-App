# Karaveya Task Prioritization App
 An app to help those with ADD and other focus-diverting issues prioritize tasks based on two factors: 
 1) general priority and
 2) 2) daily priority -- this can help people more easily visualize and choose important tasks for THAT day, circumventing decision paralysis


Personal Task Prioritization System
Objective: Organize tasks into categories and prioritize them using both static and fluctuating rating systems.

Step 1: Task Categorization
Instructions:

List Categories:

Yardwork
Cleaning
Personal Creative Projects
GME Projects
Other
Add Tasks:

Write down each task under its respective category.
Step 2: Static Rating System
Objective: Assign a static priority level to each task.

Instructions:

Assign Priorities:
Priority 1: Urgent and important (e.g., meeting a client deadline)
Priority 2: Important but not urgent (e.g., planning a GME project)
Priority 3: Urgent but not important (e.g., replying to routine emails)
Priority 4: Neither urgent nor important but still necessary (e.g., mowing the yard)
Priority 5: Low-priority tasks (e.g., reorganizing books)
Example:

Yardwork:

Mow the lawn (Priority 4)
Trim the hedges (Priority 4)
Cleaning:

Vacuum the living room (Priority 3)
Deep clean the kitchen (Priority 2)
Personal Creative Projects:

Write a short story (Priority 2)
Finish Blender tutorial (Priority 3)
GME Projects:

Step 3: Fluctuating Rating System
Objective: Prioritize tasks daily based on current energy levels and circumstances.

Instructions:

Daily Task Selection:

Each morning, review tasks marked with Priority 1 and Priority 2 from the static rating system.
Present these tasks in an interface for daily prioritization.
Rank-Choice Rating:

Rank tasks for the day based on current importance and feasibility.
Example Interface:

Today's Tasks:

Develop campaign outline (Priority 1)
Deep clean the kitchen (Priority 2)

Review rule changes (Priority 2)
Rank-Choice Rating:

Step 4: Visualization and Interaction
Objective: Create a simple and visual interface to manage tasks.

Show a list of daily prioritized tasks based on the rank-choice rating.
Allow easy drag-and-drop to adjust priorities as needed.
Weekly Overview:

Display tasks with their static priorities to plan the week ahead.
Highlight high-priority tasks that haven't been completed.
Example Layout:

Daily Dashboard:
