App Objectives

One of the things I struggle with, especially with my chronic fatigue, is organizing my thoughts at the beginning of the day clearly enough to be strategic about prioritizing tasks. Frequently, one of two things will happen:

1. I'll be over come with decision paralysis and get nothing done, or
2. I'll pick the easiest or most interesting task, regardless of whether that task is an actual priority or not

I am trying design a simple system that tracks a list of tasks across categories (for example: yardwork, cleaning, personal creative projects, client projects, etc) and gives them two rating systems.

The first system would be a static rating system. When the task is first entered into the system, I assign it a priority level (1-5, with 1 being high priority and 5 being low). For instance, moving the yard might be a level 4 or 5 priority. It needs to happen, but it's not urgent.

The second system would be a fluctuating rating system. Every day, tasks that were marked with Priority 1 or Priority 2 from the static rating system would appear in an interface. The system would present these tasks to me and then ask me to rate them again, this time ranking their priority for THAT DAY ONLY. I imagine this would be some sort of ranked-choice rating system.

That way, I have a simple, visual, and interactive way to understand the tasks on hand and then prioritize them for a given day. This would help me accommodate my fluctuating energy levels as well as the random life events that disrupt schedules (like an unexpected client deadline).

Functionality that still needs to be built:
- Changing the daily prioritization system from a 1-5 priority list to a ranked choice list, applicable only to that day.
- Making the daily ranked choice list reset every day (perhaps at midnight, or a time specified by the user based on their circadian rhythm and/or work schedule and habits)
- Beautifying the UI
- Adding simple instructions on how to use the app
